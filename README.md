Data Classification
===================

This project features the `irisclassification.py` file that uses three classifiers (*k*-nearest neighbours, decision trees, and Gaussian Naive Bayes) and ten-fold cross-validation on the iris dataset from scikit-learn to determine which one yields the most accurate results. It also generates a graph to visualize the data points used from each set. The Jupyter Notebook file alongside it (`Iris Sepal Classification.ipynb`) displays the output of a sample run of the program.
